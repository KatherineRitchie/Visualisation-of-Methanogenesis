# Project Proposal

For my final project, I will be creating an Open FrameWorks GUI to dynamically model the metabolism of a _Methanosarcina acetivorans_ cell. The animation will make the assumption that the metabolism exists in a perfectly homogenous liquid. The model will be displayed in the form of a [Markov chain] graph, where the nodes of the graph are metabolites and the edges of the graph are reactions. The concentration of the metabolites will be displayed as colour intensity and users will be able to watch as _M. acetivorans_ produces cell growth and methane from acetate. The Markov chain percentages (which will represent the chemical rate constants) will be derived from [a paper authored by _Joseph Peterson et. al._](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/archaea/2014/898453/) in 2015 where tsoftware is used to model the metabolism of _M. acetivorans_. This simulation application will be novel to Peterson's work because of the unique Markov chain graphical display. However, it will also be less useful because, unlike Peterson's simulation, this simulation will not be spatially resolved. In other words, it will not account for the fact that different portions of the cell have different concentrations of certain chemicals.

To properyl model the chemical reactions, I will be using the [Chemical Master Equation (CME)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/037843719290283V/1-s2.0-037843719290283V-main.pdf?_tid=e3680e57-0bb8-4591-8121-f5a80785b307&acdnat=1523417636_842d429be434810bdafaa98f1970821f), a well known equation created by D. T. Gillespie for stochastically modelling reactions in a homogenous liquid. Since January, I have been shadowing the Luthey-Shulten Lab and learning about computer simulations about cells and [Lattice Microbe](http://www.scs.illinois.edu/schulten/Papers/Peterson_et_al_PyHPC_2013.pdf), a software package that uses the CME. I will also be spending the summer conducting research on microscopy image processing for use in whole-cell simulations. Thus, I am familiar with the concepts of chemical simulations, able to read scientific papers and aware of the strengths and limitations of simulating an environment using this Markov Chain model.

To improve the functionality of my application, I will be using the [events](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/events/) library of openframeworks to allow a user to press and hold a key to scroll forward and back in time. I will also be using the [2d graphics](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/) library to allow me to describe the intricate graph of _M. acetivorans_ metabolism.
