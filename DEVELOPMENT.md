April 18 - Thus far three classes and a Makefile have been created. Metabolite will be the nodes on the graph. Reaction will hold functions involved in executing time based movement of the metabolites. Metabolite and Reaction have both been tested. The next step would be to integrate the ODE into the Reaction class and begin brainstorming ways to hard-code the metabolism into the application.
April 19 - Enzyme class has been created.
April 21 - implementation of rapid json library and creation of load.cpp.
April 22 - creation of file to string functionality
April 23 - worked on writing pathway constructor and pathway test cases, having trouble working with rapid json library
April 24 - Added equality operator overloading after issues with const. Wrote enzyme test cases.
April 25 - Finished writing the json-filename-to-pathway constructor. Huzzah! It works based off of debugging software but test cases are not working for unknown reasons.
