April 18 - Thus far three classes and a Makefile have been created. Metabolite will be the nodes on the graph. Reaction will hold functions involved in executing time based movement of the metabolites. Metabolite and Reaction have both been tested. The next step would be to integrate the ODE into the Reaction class and begin brainstorming ways to hard-code the metabolism into the application.
April 19 - Enzyme class has been created.
